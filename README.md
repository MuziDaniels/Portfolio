> **"Building resilient, scalable systems. One pipeline at a time."**

This is a high-performance, single-page portfolio designed to showcase my journey from Software Engineering Learner to Aspiring Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). It features a modern "Glassmorphism" aesthetic, fluid GSAP animations, and a fully responsive layout.

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The design is inspired by the engineering blogs of Linear, Vercel, and Stripe—focusing on **"Calm Confidence."**

* **Visual Style:** Deep Navy & Teal palette with frosted glass cards.
* **Interaction:** Magnetic cursors (desktop) and smooth staggered fade-ins.
* **Performance:** Zero-build step required, utilizing Tailwind via CDN and lightweight vanilla JS for maximum speed.

## 💻 Local Development

Since this project uses modern browser features and CDN links, it requires no complex build step (npm/yarn/webpack).

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/MuziDaniels/portfolio-2025.git](https://github.com/MuziDaniels/portfolio-2025.git)
    cd portfolio-2025
    ```

2.  **Run locally**
    You can open `index.html` directly in your browser, but for the best experience (to avoid CORS issues with some assets), use a live server.
    
    *If you use VS Code:*
    1. Install the "Live Server" extension.
    2. Right-click `index.html`.
    3. Select **"Open with Live Server"**.
